Work developed for Software Systems' Requirements Engineering (ERSS).

## Case Studies
The following case studies consisted of papers or articles we must analyse, synthesise and reflect upon.

Only case study 2 was analysed in group.

note: Files p0 to p7 are the reading sheets corresponding to each case study.

### Case Study 0: Requirements in the 21st Century: Current Practice and Emerging Trends
The paper approaches the subject of requirements as one the most significant challenges in software intensive systems’ design.
It takes into consideration requirements research throughout the past two decades, reviews current state-of-the-art both in practice and theory of design requirements management, identifies the gap between research and current practice and points out drivers of change in the 21st century requirements design efforts.

### Case Study 1: Business analysis and requirements engineering: the same, only different?
The paper approaches the role of business analysts by comparing it to the role of requirements engineers, particularly from the author’s own point of view considering his line of work.

### Case Study 2: What Is Design Thinking and Why Is It Important?
The paper approaches the field of design thinking and aims to synthesize the existing research on it to allow for a better understanding of its characteristics and processes, the differences between novice and expert design thinkers and apply the findings from literature regarding its application to the educational system.
Most importantly, the goal is to discuss the importance of design thinking in promoting students’ problem-solving skills in the 21st century.

### Case Study 3: Agile Requirements Engineering Practices: An Empirical Study
The paper approaches the theme of Requirements Engineering and Agile Methods application in requirements engineering.
The main focus is to reach a conclusion on which requirements engineering practices agile developers actually follow and the benefits and challenges presented by those practices.

### Case Study 4: Elicitation Technique Selection: How Do Experts Do It?
The paper approaches the theme of requirements elicitation techniques.
The main purpose is to understand and document how experts choose elicitation techniques in order to improve requirements elicitation practice and, consequently, increase the quality of future products to insure they meet the users’ needs.

### Case Study 5: What Stakeholders Will or Will Not Say: A Theoretical and Empirical Study of Topic Importance in Requirements Engineering Elicitation Interviews

### Case Study 6: Stimulating Stakeholders' Imagination: New Creativity Triggers for Eliciting Novel Requirements

### Case Study 7: Organisation and Communication Problems in Automotive Requirements Engineering
